# fqgrep-binder
Demonstrating Fulcrum Genomics' fqgrep in MyBinder-served sessions.  
Click 'launch' badge above to get started.

See [Fulcrum Genomics repo for fqgrep here](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqgrep) for more about the command line utility.

I use Jupyter Notebooks here with some code to demonstrate how easy it is to use and how you can combine `fqgrep` use in with Python coding and Jupyter conveience to more easily analyze data.


## Attribution

***Clarifying Software Attribution: I, Wayne, am not involved with Fulcrum Genomics or `fqgrep` development in any way. I simply set up this repository to demonstrate the use of it in MyBinder-served Jupyter Sessions. See the links above and below for the materials by those who develop and maintain fqgrep.***

## Not about the older fqgrep

Because later I noticed there is another fqgrep, I'll point out **this repo specifically uses as soure Fulcrum Genomics' [fqgrep repo](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqgrep)**.   
(There is an older `fqgrep` that allows insertions, deletions, and substitutions [here](https://github.com/indraniel/fqgrep). It hasn't been updated since 2016, as best I can tell, see [here](https://github.com/indraniel/fqgrep/releases/tag/v0.4.4); I'll refer to it as `indraniel/fqgrep` ot something to that effect to distinguish it. As best I can tell, `indraniel/fqgrep` doesn't offer any special handling for paired ends, like Fulcrum Genomics `fqgrep` does.)
